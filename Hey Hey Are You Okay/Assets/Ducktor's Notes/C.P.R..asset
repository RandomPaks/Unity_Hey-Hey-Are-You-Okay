  text: "C.P.R. stands for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Before using CPR, first
    check the scene and the injured or ill person. Call the Philippine Emergency
    Hotline 911 so that help is on the way. Take no more than 10 seconds to check
    if the person is breathing, and then check for bleeding. If they are not bleeding
    and not breathing, perform CPR. Check that the airway is not blocked, and perform
    30 chest compressions, then give 2 rescue breaths. Pinch the nose shut and make
    a complete seal over the person\u2019s mouth: each rescue breath should be 1
    second and make the chest clearly rise. Keep doing this cycle until help arrives."
