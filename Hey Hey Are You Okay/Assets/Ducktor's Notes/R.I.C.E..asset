  text: "R.I.C.E. stands for Rest, Immobilize, Cold, and Elevate. It is used to treat
    injuries to joints and muscles such as sprains and strain. Begin by resting the
    injured area, don\u2019t move or straighten it. Immobilize the joint using splints
    if the injured person needs to be moved or transported. Applying a cold compress
    to the area reduces swelling and pain. Lastly, elevate the area only if it doesn\u2019t
    cause more pain. This can help reduce swelling. "
