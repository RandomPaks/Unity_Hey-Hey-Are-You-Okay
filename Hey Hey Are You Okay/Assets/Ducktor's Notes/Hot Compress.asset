  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  text: "A hot compress is used to increase bloodflow to the area where it\u2019s
    applied. These reduce joint stiffness and muscle spasm, which is useful for tight
    muscles. Do not use hot compress in the first 48 hours after an injury. Hot compress
    is normally used to help sore muscles after exercise, but not for injury. Always
    make sure that there is proper insulation between the hot compress and the person\u2019s
    skin."
