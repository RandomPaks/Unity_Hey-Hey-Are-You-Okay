  text: "A tool used to immobilize an injured part so that movement is minimized
    to prevent any further injury. Splints should only be used if the injured person
    needs to be moved or transported and only if it doesn\u2019t cause more pain.
    When dealing with fractures or sprains, apply the splints above and below the
    site of the injury, but never directly tied onto the injury itself."
